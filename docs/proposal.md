# VistaShare Project Proposal

## 1. Motivation & Objective

In most modern cars, we have cameras and radar and various other sensors to protect driving safety. However, in certain scenarios, the driver's vision might be blocked by large vehicles and trucks. This could be dangerous as the driver can not see incoming cars, bikes, or pedestrians and can cause road accidents. Therefore, we aim to design an embedded system that detects such scenarios where the driver's vision is blocked and provide them with real-time video of the visually blocked area from camera on a nearby car. 

## 2. State of the Art & Its Limitations

In recent years, there have been considerable research and projects in the field of V2V (vehicle-to-vehicle) communication. The main motivation for vehicular communication systems is safety and eliminating the excessive cost of traffic collisions. However, such system can be heavily interfered over the spectrum of other applications. 

## 3. Novelty & Rationale

In our approach, we aim to use wifi to transport the live video due to its high bandwidth and stability.
